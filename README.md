# deepl_dart

[![Dart Analyze & Test](https://github.com/komape/deepl_dart/actions/workflows/dart_analyze_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/komape/deepl_dart/actions/workflows/dart_analyze_test.yml)

**This package is maintained by volunteers but is not a supported DeepL product and not maintained by DeepL SE. Issues here are answered by maintainers and other community members on GitHub on a best-effort basis.**

This package is heavily inspired by the [official Node.js Client Library for the DeepL API](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-node):

>The DeepL API is a language translation API that allows other computer programs to send texts and documents to DeepL's servers and receive high-quality translations. This opens a whole universe of opportunities for developers: any translation product you can imagine can now be built on top of DeepL's best-in-class translation technology.
>
>The DeepL *[Dart]* library offers a convenient way for applications written for *[Dart and Flutter]* to interact with the DeepL API. We intend to support all API functions with the library, though support for new features may be added to the library after theyâ€™re added to the API. *~ DeepL*

## Getting an authentication key

To use the package, you'll need an API authentication key. To get a key, [please create an account here](https://www.deepl.com/pro/change-plan#developer). You can translate up to 500,000characters/month for free.

## Roadmap

- [x] [Translating text](https://www.deepl.com/de/docs-api/translating-text/)
- [x] [Translating Document](https://www.deepl.com/de/docs-api/translating-documents/)
- [ ] [Managing Glossaries](https://www.deepl.com/de/docs-api/managing-glossaries/)
- [ ] [Monitoring usage](https://www.deepl.com/de/docs-api/other-functions/monitoring-usage/)
- [ ] [Listing supported languages](https://www.deepl.com/de/docs-api/other-functions/listing-supported-languages/)

## Installation

In the `dependencies`: section of your `pubspec.yaml`, add the following line:

```yaml
dependencies:
  deepl_dart: <latest_version>
```

## Usage

Import the package and construct a `Translator`. The required argument `authKey` is a string containing your API authentication key as found in your [DeepL Pro Account](https://www.deepl.com/pro-account/).

Be careful not to expose your key, for example when sharing source code.

An example using `async/await`:

```dart
import 'package:deepl_dart/deepl_dart.dart';

void main() async {
  // Construct Translator
  Translator translator = Translator(authKey: '<your_auth_key>');

  // Translate text
  TextResult result =
      await translator.translateTextSingular('Hello World', 'de');
  print(result);

  // Translate list of texts
  List<TextResult> results =
      await translator.translateTextList(['Hello World', 'Hola Mundo'], 'de');
  print(results);
}
```

This example is for demonstration purposes only. In production code, the authentication key should not be hard-coded, but instead fetched from a configuration file or environment variable.
